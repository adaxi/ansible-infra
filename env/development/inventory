;
; In this example a single media server (mean) is added to
; the mediaserver group.
; 
; The mediaserver group was only tested against Debian Wheezy.
;
; The mediaservers will require to become root on the machine.
; As its not a good practice to run as root, I recommend using
; sudo. You will also require ssh running. On a fresh install:
;
; # su root
; # apt-get install sudo ssh -y
; # usermod -a -G sudo <username>
